    <h3>Titanic</h3>
    <p>It is the best romance thriller of all time. It showcase true love and no toxicity in the love between Jack and Rose. At the time the movie is filled with thriller as it shows the sinking incident of the great Titanic.It really gets emotional at the end but teaches us a lot of good lessons.

    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
    <p>It is an amazing movie on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima Ngasaaki. Directed by Christopher Nolan and role of Dr Oppenheimer played by Cillian Murphy, this is movie showcases a physicist's mind in an amzing way. Its a must watch for physics lovers.

    <h3>OMG</h3>
    <p>This is a mind blowing movie. It shows the reality of all the so called religions. It is an amazing movie, every person should watch it. It alligns with my thoughts a lot. It mocks all these human made religions in such a realistic way. I have learnt a lot from that movie. Hatts off to the writers and the actors.
